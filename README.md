JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

Complete these 5 JavaScript projects to earn the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification.

- Palindrome Checker
Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.
Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.
We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.
We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as 2A3*3a2, 2A3 3a2, and 2_A3*3#A2.


- Roman Numeral Converter
Convert the given number into a roman numeral.
All roman numerals answers should be provided in upper-case.


- Telephone Number Validator
Return true if the passed string looks like a valid US phone number.


- Caesars Cipher
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.
A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus A ↔ N, B ↔ O and so on.
Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.
All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.


- Cash Register
Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

cid is a 2D array listing available currency.

The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.

Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.

Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

See below for an example of a cash-in-drawer array:

[
  ["PENNY", 1.01],
  ["NICKEL", 2.05],
  ["DIME", 3.1],
  ["QUARTER", 4.25],
  ["ONE", 90],
  ["FIVE", 55],
  ["TEN", 20],
  ["TWENTY", 60],
  ["ONE HUNDRED", 100]
]
